This is an example Dockerfile that installs the Aryn OpenSearch plugin built for OpenSearch 3.4.0.

If your user ID (uid) and group ID (gid) are different from 1000, edit the file to change the last line to:

USER <uid>:<gid>

where uid and gid match the user under which you will be running the Docker container.

You can then build an image like this:

>> docker build -t aryn-opensearch .

And then use the docker run command from https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/docker/ to bring up the container.
